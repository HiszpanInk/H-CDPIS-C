# H-CDPIS-C
Hiszpan's Central Dynamic Passenger Information System Client
This is a part of my project to create simple system similiar to PKP PLK CSDIP. This is a client - it will display information similiar to some types of displays used on polish train stations. Design is based very loosely on information in PKP PLK IPI-6 document (https://www.plk-sa.pl/files/public/user_upload/pdf/Akty_prawne_i_przepisy/Instrukcje/Wydruk/Ipi/Ipi-6.pdf)(it won't look like that because I stubbornly do not want to do it using some proper front end framework so it won't look good but idc)
